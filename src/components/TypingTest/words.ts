  "Subway cars rattled through underground tunnels, carrying passengers from one part of the city to another. Each stop brought a changing composition of riders, some beginning their journeys while others reached their destinations. Maps on the walls helped newcomers navigate the complex system of lines and transfers. Regular commuters, familiar with the rhythm of the transit system, used travel time to read, listen to music, or simply watch the passing scene of urban life. Below the streets, this parallel world moved people efficiently through the metropolis."
